//How it Works

Structure of Repo

our repo's name is anotherdaywithparadise and we have been using a git repository through Heroku. When in the repository this is how you can test and run our code. You can either go to the online version of our repository to see the latest version of the app. However to work on the app and do local testing, when in the directory anotherdaywith paradise you can call "python3 PLACEHOLDER runserver" to see the local version of the app that is running on your computer. Adding, Pushing, Pulling, Commiting are the same as any git commands for those things would be.
