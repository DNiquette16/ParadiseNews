# Paradise News
## The Idea
Paradise News is the news that you have been looking for. Our app brings in credible news sources like ESPN, the Wall Street Journal, NBC and more, but the community decides what will be on the front page based on what they like. Our app brings together the credibility of real news sources with the community and customizability of reddit-style forums.
## How it Works
### Structure of Repo
Our repo's name is *anotherdaywithparadise* and we have been using git through Heroku. This repo is a clone of our Heroku one so we can share with you our code. Since Django is our web framework, the organization of the repo is based on the organizational structure of Django. The code is separated into projects and applications, and the HTML is written in templates. The full structure can be found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/.
### Running and Testing the Code
#### Live
The latest version of our app is available at https://anotherdaywithparadise.herokuapp.com/.
#### Local
To work on the app and do local testing, clone the code. Then in the top level direction you can launch the server.
```
python manage.py runserver
```
It will begin a local server and give you an address to navigate to. You can test any changes or fixes that you make. Then you can add, commit, push, and pull using the standard git controls.
